      <h5 class="font-weight-bold">1. What is Spring Framework?</h5>
      <p class="text-indent-3">
          Spring is one of the most widely used Java EE framework. Spring framework core concepts are “Dependency Injection” and “Aspect Oriented Programming”.
      </p>
      <p class="text-indent-3">
          Spring framework can be used in normal java applications also to achieve loose coupling between different components by implementing dependency injection and we can perform cross cutting tasks such as logging and authentication using spring support for aspect oriented programming.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">2. What are the features and advantages Spring Framework?</h5>    
        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
            <p class="h5">Features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Lightweight and very little overhead of using framework for our development.</li>
              <li>Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control to write components that are independent of each other, spring container takes care of wiring them together to achieve our work.</li>
              <li>Spring IoC container manages Spring Bean life cycle and project specific configurations such as JNDI lookup.</li>
              <li>Spring MVC framework can be used to create web applications as well as restful web services capable of returning XML as well as JSON response.</li>
              <li>Support for transaction management, JDBC operations, File uploading, Exception Handling etc with very little configurations, either by using annotations or by spring bean configuration file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="h5">Advantages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reducing direct dependencies between different components of the application, usually Spring IoC container is responsible for initializing resources or beans and inject them as dependencies.</li>
              <li>Writing unit test cases are easy in Spring framework because our business logic doesn’t have direct dependencies with actual resource implementation classes. We can easily write a test configuration and inject our mock beans for testing purposes.</li>
              <li>Reduces the amount of boiler-plate code, such as initializing objects, open/close resources. I like JdbcTemplate class a lot because it helps us in removing all the boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC programming.</li>
              <li>Spring framework is divided into several modules, it helps us in keeping our application lightweight. For example, if we don’t need Spring transaction management features, we don’t need to add that dependency in our project.</li>
              <li>Spring framework support most of the Java EE features and even much more. It’s always on top of the new technologies, for example there is a Spring project for Android to help us write better code for native android applications. This makes spring framework a complete package and we don’t need to look after different framework for different requirements.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">3. What is Dependency Injection?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Dependency Injection design pattern allows us to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable and maintainable. We can implement dependency injection pattern to move the dependency resolution from compile-time to runtime.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Some of the benefits of using Dependency Injection are: Separation of Concerns, Boilerplate Code reduction, Configurable components and easy unit testing.
        </p>

        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">4. How we does implement DI in Spring Framework?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            We can use Spring XML based as well as Annotation based configuration to implement DI in spring applications. For better understanding

        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">5. Name some of the important Spring Modules?</h5>
        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
            <p>Some of the important Spring Framework modules are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring Context</span> – for dependency injection.</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring AOP</span> – for aspect oriented programming.</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring DAO</span> – for database operations using DAO pattern</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring JDBC</span> – for JDBC and DataSource support.</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring ORM</span> – for ORM tools support such as Hibernate</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring Web Module</span> – for ORM tools support such as Hibernate</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Spring MVC</span> – Model-View-Controller implementation for creating web applications, web services etc.</li>
            </ul>

    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">6. What is Spring IOC Container?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Inversion of Control (IoC) is the mechanism to achieve loose-coupling between Objects dependencies. 
            To achieve loose coupling and dynamic binding of the objects at runtime, the objects define their dependencies that are being injected by other assembler objects. Spring IoC container is the program that injects dependencies into an object and make it ready for our use.
        </p>

        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
            <ul>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">ClassPathXmlApplicationContext</span> - For standalone java applications using XML based configuration.</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">FileSystemXmlApplicationContext</span> - Similar to ClassPathXmlApplicationContext except that the xml configuration file can be loaded from anywhere in the file system.</li>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">AnnotationConfigApplicationContext</span> - For standalone java applications using annotations based configuration.</li>

        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">8. What is a Spring Bean?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Any normal java class that is initialized by Spring IoC container is called Spring Bean. We use Spring ApplicationContext to get the Spring Bean instance.Spring IoC container manages the life cycle of Spring Bean, bean scopes and injecting any required dependencies in the bean.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">9. What are different ways to configure a class as Spring Bean?</h5>
        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
          <p>There are three different ways to configure Spring Bean.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">XML configuration</span>
                <p>This is the most popular configuration and we can use bean element in context file to configure a Spring Bean.</p>
                <p class="code_box">
                    &lt;bean name="myBean" class="com.journaldev.spring.beans.MyBean"&gt;&lt;/bean&gt;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Annotation Based configuration</span>
                <p>We can also use @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Controller annotations with classes to configure them to be as spring bean. For these, we would need to provide base package location to scan for these classes. </p>
                <p class="code_box">
                    &lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;
                    <br>
                    &lt;context:component-scan base-package="com.journaldev.spring"/&gt;
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">Java Based configuration</span>
                <p> If you are using only annotations, you can configure a Spring bean using @Bean annotation. This annotation is used with @Configuration classes to configure a spring bean. Sample configuration is:</p>
                <pre class="code_box">                   
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(value="com.journaldev.spring.main")
public class MyConfiguration {{'{'}}

	@Bean
	public MyService getService(){{'{'}}
		return new MyService();
	}
}
                </pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">10. What are different scopes of Spring Bean?</h5>
        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
          <p>There are five scopes defined for Spring Beans.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">singleton</span> - Only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans. While using this scope, make sure spring bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues because it’s not thread-safe.</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">prototype</span> - A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">request</span> - This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">session</span> - A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">global-session</span> - This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-muted"><span class="font-weight-bold">Note: </span>Spring Framework is extendable and we can create our own scopes too, however most of the times we are good with the scopes provided by the framework.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">11. What is Spring Bean life cycle?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Spring Beans are initialized by Spring Container and all the dependencies are also injected. When context is destroyed, it also destroys all the initialized beans. This works well in most of the cases but sometimes we want to initialize other resources or do some validation before making our beans ready to use. Spring framework provides support for post-initialization and pre-destroy methods in spring beans.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            We can do this by two ways – by implementing InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces or using init-method and destroy-method attribute in spring bean configurations.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">12. What is Bean wiring and @Autowired annotation?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            The process of injection spring bean dependencies while initializing it called Spring Bean Wiring.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Usually it’s best practice to do the explicit wiring of all the bean dependencies, but spring framework also supports autowiring. We can use @Autowired annotation with fields or methods for autowiring byType. For this annotation to work, we also need to enable annotation based configuration in spring bean configuration file. This can be done by context:annotation-config element.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">13. What are different types of Spring Bean autowiring?</h5>
        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
          <p>There are three types of autowiring in Spring framework.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>byName</li>
            <li>byType</li>
            <li>byConstructor</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Prior to Spring 3.1, autowire by autodetect was also supported that was similar to autowire by constructor or byType.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">14. Does Spring Bean provide thread safety?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            The default scope of Spring bean is singleton, so there will be only one instance per context. That means that all the having a class level variable that any thread can update will lead to inconsistent data. Hence in default mode spring beans are not thread-safe.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            However we can change spring bean scope to request, prototype or session to achieve thread-safety at the cost of performance. It’s a design decision and based on the project requirements.
        </p>

    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">15. What is a Controller in Spring MVC?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            Just like MVC design pattern, Controller is the class that takes care of all the client requests and send them to the configured resources to handle it. In Spring MVC, org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet is the front controller class that initializes the context based on the spring beans configurations.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            A Controller class is responsible to handle different kind of client requests based on the request mappings. We can create a controller class by using @Controller annotation. Usually it’s used with @RequestMapping annotation to define handler methods for specific URI mapping.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row col-12 my-3">
        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">16. What’s the difference between @Component, @Controller, @Repository & @Service annotations in Spring?</h5>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">@Component</span> is used to indicate that a class is a component. These classes are used for auto detection and configured as bean, when annotation based configurations are used.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">@Controller</span> is a specific type of component, used in MVC applications and mostly used with RequestMapping annotation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">@Repository</span> annotation is used to indicate that a component is used as repository and a mechanism to store/retrieve/search data. We can apply this annotation with DAO pattern implementation classes.
        </p>
        <p class="text-indent-3">
            <span class="font-weight-bold">@Service</span> is used to indicate that a class is a Service. Usually the business facade classes that provide some services are annotated with this.
        </p>

        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">17. Can we have multiple Spring configuration files?</h5>
        <div class="ml-3 col-12">
          <p>Yes, we can have multiple configuration files in spring.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">XML</span> - Using import option, we can import another xml files into common xml file.
              <p class="code_box">
                &lt;import resource="other-beans.xml"/&gt;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Annotation</span> - Using @Import, we can import another config class into main config class.
              <p class="code_box">
                @Configuration<br>
                @Import(DataSourceConfig.class)<br>
                public class AppConfig{{'{'}}<br>
                .....<br>
                }

            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Context</span> - While creating context, we can supply multiple config files.
              <p class="code_box">
                  ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("config1.xml","config2.xml");<br>
                  (OR)<br>
                  ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(config1.class,config2.class);
